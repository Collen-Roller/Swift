#Swift

A repository dedicated to various ios applications i've written in swift

##Fun Facts 

Random fact app, intended to teach entry level swift concepts to beginners.
This was the first ios app I made. It uses an array of "FunFacts" and will display
a new fact everytime a button is selected.

##Stormy

Basic Weather Application for Potsdam NY
Shows user the temperate, humidity, and a nice looking image depicting the current weather state.
Supports concurrency in Swift, and proper network protocals.
Weather info is JSON data retrieved from forcast.developer.io

##Tic Tac Toe

Simple Tic Tac Toe application. The appliation uses two main screens, a title screen which
allows users to choose a game mode, and a AI mode which allows users to play against the
computer. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm which I implemented in Swift. The application is
basic and does not include any detailed animations. Once a player has won, the user can replay
or quit to the start screen.
